/*
 *  ioctl.c - the process to use ioctl's to control the kernel module
 *
 *  Every device can have its own ioctl commands to send information 
 *  from a process to the kernel, write information to a process, both 
 *  or neither.  The ioctl function is called with three parameters: 
 *    the file descriptor of the appropriate device file, 
 *    the ioctl number, 
 *    and an open parameter of type long
 *
 *  The ioctl number encodes the major device number, the type of the ioctl, 
 *  the command, and the type of the parameter.  The ioctl number is usually 
 *  created by a macro call (_IO, _IOR, _IOW or _IOWR --- depending on the 
 *  type) in a header file.  This header file should then be included both 
 *  by the programs which will use ioctl and by the kernel module.  The
 *  header file is 'sys/ioctl.h'
 *
 *  It is best to receive an official ioctl assignment, so if you accidentally 
 *  get somebody else's ioctls, or if they get yours, you'll know something is 
 *  wrong.
 *
 *  Until now we could have used cat for input and output.  But now
 *  we need to do ioctl's, which require writing our own process.
 *
 *  Note: ioctl's read is to send information to the kernel and its write 
 *  is to receive information from the kernel.
